<div class="HopperContent">
  <p>Edward Hopper's paintings tend to fit into one of two categories: everday American life or landscapes. He considered himself a realist painter, but that's about it -- he did not associate himself with any specific schools of art, even though many of his contemporaries aligned themselves with the Ashcan School.</p>
  <p>Hopper's landscapes are generally lighter in tone; he did not paint cloudy, rainy, or stormy scenes, even though he often took his inspiration from the sea. "House by the Railroad" is one of his most famous landscapes, which blends traditional architecture with more modern ideas of transportation and technology.</p>
  <p>When Hopper includes figures in his work, he generally emphasizes their environment and the way in which they interact with it. Each person he paints in contextualized by their immediate surroundings. He emphasizes attitudes of loneliness, solitude, boredom, and solemnity. Many critics have noted that Hopper's figures are painted as if they were observed just before or after the climax of an event, but never in a truly "important" moment.</p>
